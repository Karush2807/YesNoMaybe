# Machine Learning Project Requirements

### 1. Dataset Files
- 2 CSV files:
  - Training dataset
  - Testing dataset

### 2. Python Code (IPYNB format)
The code must include:
- Libraries installation
- Data cleansing and transformation process
- Main descriptive statistics of the dataset
- Splitting of training and testing datasets
- Model implementation
- Results and interpretation as comments (R2/Accuracy/Best estimator/etc.)
- Testing estimators
- Comprehensive code comments explaining the workflow

### 3. PDF Documentation
The PDF must contain:
- Model explanation and insights
- Performance metrics (Accuracy/R2/Efficiency parameters) for both training and testing datasets
- Detailed methodology for tackling the case:
  - Data cleaning approach
  - Model selection reasoning
  - Training process
  - Testing methodology

### 4. Analysis Questions to Answer
a. What type of model is your algorithm, supervised or unsupervised learning?
b. Is it a regression, classification, or clustering problem?
c. Why did you use that algorithm?
d. What is the main question or problem you want to solve?



I will provide you with one cvs file with a dataset from participants in an experimental speed dating event where they rated the "date" with six attributes (ex. attractiveness, fun, intelligence, etc) as well as data from the participants (ex. demographics, dating habits,  etc)
I need a logistic model that will predict if the participants would have a second date or not.

For this project I need:
-2 csv files with the datasets used for training and testing the model.
-A Python code, in ipynb format. This code must have at least:
• Libraries installation.
• Cleansing process and transformation of the dataset.
• Main descriptive statistics of the dataset.
• Splitting training and testing datasets.
• Model.
• Results and interpretation as comments (R2/Accuracy/Best estimator/etc.)
• Testing estimators.
• Comments explaining the code.
-A PDF file with:
• The model and the explanation of the insights of the model,
accuracy/R2/EPiciency parameters of training and testing datasets.
• The steps you followed to tackle the case: i.e. cleaning the data, choosing the
model, training, testing, etc.
• The following questions answered:
a. What type of model is your algorithm, supervised or unsupervised learning?
b. Is it a regression, classification, or clustering problem?
c. Why did you use that algorithm?
d. What is the main question or problem you want to solve?
