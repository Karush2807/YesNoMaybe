# Machine Learning Project Requirements

### 1. Dataset Files
- 2 CSV files:
  - Training dataset
  - Testing dataset

### 2. Python Code (IPYNB format)
The code must include:
- Libraries installation
- Data cleansing and transformation process
- Main descriptive statistics of the dataset
- Splitting of training and testing datasets
- Model implementation
- Results and interpretation as comments (R2/Accuracy/Best estimator/etc.)
- Testing estimators
- Comprehensive code comments explaining the workflow

### 3. PDF Documentation
The PDF must contain:
- Model explanation and insights
- Performance metrics (Accuracy/R2/Efficiency parameters) for both training and testing datasets
- Detailed methodology for tackling the case:
  - Data cleaning approach
  - Model selection reasoning
  - Training process
  - Testing methodology

### 4. Analysis Questions to Answer
a. What type of model is your algorithm, supervised or unsupervised learning?
b. Is it a regression, classification, or clustering problem?
c. Why did you use that algorithm?
d. What is the main question or problem you want to solve?
